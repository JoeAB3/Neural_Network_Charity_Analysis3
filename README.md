# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19

Using machine learning and neural networks, the team will use the features in the provided attached dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

What is being created:
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

Deliverable #1:
